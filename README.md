# HTML TABLE EXTRACTOR

This project is part of an assignment for the Data Products Coursera Course.

*Problem*: In many non-governamental sites there is data available only thought html, without a file export option. This makes specifict data collection difficult.

*Project Objectives*: To extract data from html tables into a data.frame object and perform preliminary analysis.

*Scope*: HTML pages with "**\<table\>**", "**\<th\>**", "**\<tr\>**", "**\<td\>**" tags, ***properly*** used.
